            <p>
              If you're building an app, or any kind of software through an agency, freelancers or AI tools and you don't
              have a technical lead, Qube Catalyst gives you end-to-end direction, from making sense of the
              build, to shaping flows, user experience and launch so the product works in the real world.

            <h2>Who I work with</h2>
            <p>
              I work with founders and product owners who are responsible for an app, but don't come from
              an engineering background:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Founders working with agencies or freelancers to build their app.</li>
              <li>Teams who are being pushed to "just ship it" without clear guidance.</li>
              <li>People using AI tools to build products but unsure if what's being delivered will hold up.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>How Qube Catalyst helps</h2>
        <p class="section-muted">
          Q³ transforms how non-technical founders build and launch apps by fusing technical oversight,
          quality thinking and practical leadership so you can launch with confidence instead of hope.

            <h3>Micro Confidence Review</h3>
            <p>
              A focused review of your 3–4 most critical flows. I walk through them like a real user,
              surface what's breaking, and give you a clear, severity-based action list you can hand
              straight to your build team.

            <h3>Launch Compass – Product Readiness Tool</h3>
            <p>
              A guided, plain-English tool for non-technical founders. Capture how your product works,
              what matters most, and where the risks are. Launch Compass generates a structured plan
              and a confidence view so you can decide when you're truly ready to go live.
