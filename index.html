          <h1>I help you turn messy app builds into launch-ready products that actually work.</h1>
          <p>
            If you’re building an app, or any kind of software through an agency, freelancers or AI tools and you don’t
            have a
            technical lead, Qube Catalyst gives you end-to-end direction, from making sense of the
            build, to shaping flows, user experience and launch so the product works in the real world.

        <h2>Who I work with</h2>
        <p>
          I work with founders and product owners who are responsible for an app, but don’t come from
          an engineering background:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Founders working with agencies or freelancers to build their app.</li>
          <li>Teams who are being pushed to “just ship it” without clear guidance.</li>
          <li>People using AI tools to build products but unsure if what’s being delivered will hold up.</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Micro Confidence Review</h3>
            <p>
              A focused review of your 3–4 most critical flows. I walk through them like a real user,
              surface what’s breaking, and give you a clear, severity-based action list you can hand
              straight to your build team.

            <h3>Launch Compass – Product Readiness Tool</h3>
            <p>
              A guided, plain-English tool for non-technical founders. Capture how your product works,
              what matters most, and where the risks are. Launch Compass generates a structured plan
              and a confidence view so you can decide when you're truly ready to go live.
