HOME PAGE
1. Hero section

Use your current headline + add OPTION 6 as the subtext:

Clear direction for founders building apps without a technical lead.
I help you turn a chaotic, unclear build into a product that actually works — with clearer flows, stronger decisions and a confident path to launch.

This sets the frame instantly:
non-tech founders → building apps → lacking technical leadership → you provide clarity.

2. Under the hero — “THE REAL PROBLEM FOUNDERS FACE” (OPTION 2)

This sits perfectly as the first major section after the hero.

Why:

It mirrors the frustrations founders feel

It sells the problem before the solution

It positions you as the antidote to chaos and blind spots

Use it exactly as written.

3. Services section

No change needed except tightening copy later.

This sits after the problem so your services feel like the logical response.

4. Before the final CTA at the bottom — “THE TRANSFORMATION” (OPTION 5)

This is your emotional turning point.

It shifts them from:

“Yes, this is my problem”
to

“Yes, she is the person who can fix it.”

This section converts extremely well because it frames the before → after.

⭐ ABOUT & SERVICES PAGE

This page should tell a deeper story, so we layer complexity gradually.

1. Introduction (your existing About intro)

Keep your Meta + 20-year experience + product clarity angle.

2. “WHY Q³ EXISTS” (OPTION 1)

This section fits beautifully near the top of the About page.

It helps express your mission:

Why you built Q³

Why this problem matters

Why non-tech founders need your leadership

Place it after your personal intro.

3. “WHAT’S ACTUALLY HAPPENING (BUT NOBODY SAYS IT)” (OPTION 3)

This is the strongest anti-guru, truthful section.

Put this right before your services list.

This primes founders to feel seen and understood before you show them what you offer.

This section does the emotional heavy lifting.

4. “HOW Q³ FIXES THIS” (OPTION 4)

Place this as the Services explanation block.

This is where you articulate your methodology and thinking, not the packages themselves.

Here’s the flow:

Intro → Why Q³ → What’s Actually Happening → How Q³ Fixes This → Services Cards

That’s the right narrative arc.

⭐ CONTACT PAGE

This page stays mostly lean.

But you can add OPTION 5 (The Transformation) as a small block above your final contact CTA.

It reinforces that reaching out = moving from chaos → clarity.
