TASK:
In this Next.js + Tailwind project (VerAIQ), create a fully designed “VerAIQ Partner Programme” landing page at /partners and lightly update the footer to link to it.

TECH + STYLE REQUIREMENTS

Tech: Next.js App Router + React + Tailwind CSS (assume this stack).

Create a new page at: app/partners/page.tsx (or .jsx depending on the project convention).

Use VerAIQ / Q³ brand-inspired colours (define them in Tailwind or inline utility classes as needed):

Primary deep teal: #022C3A

Dark navy background: #020817

Accent electric green: #22C55E

Accent warm coral: #FB7185

Soft grey text: #CBD5F5

Off-white background sections: #0B1220 / #020617

Design language:

Modern SaaS landing page.

Large hero section, clear CTAs, alternating dark/light sections.

Generous spacing, rounded cards (rounded-2xl), subtle shadows.

Layout should be responsive and look good on mobile and desktop.

IMAGES / VISUALS

Create simple hero + illustration sections that visually represent:

Development agencies and freelancers working on client projects.

Collaboration between dev teams and non-technical founders.

Since we’re in code, do NOT call external APIs. Use:

Either simple SVG illustrations defined as React components (e.g. abstract dev team scene with screens/avatars).

Or placeholder <div> with gradient backgrounds and icons (Heroicons / Lucide) that we can later replace with real images.

Put these visuals in:

Hero section (left copy, right illustration).

A mid-page “How agencies use VerAIQ” section with a visual.

PAGE STRUCTURE + COPY

Build the /partners page with the following sections and copy. Use headings, subheadings, and Tailwind-styled components (cards, grids, etc.). You can adjust exact HTML tags but don’t change the text except for minor formatting like line breaks.

HERO SECTION

Big title, subtitle, and 2 primary CTAs.

Copy:

Title:
Turn Client Chaos into Clean Launches (and Earn Recurring Revenue)

Subheadline:
VerAIQ gives your non-technical clients a guided QA and launch readiness tool. You get fewer “is it ready?” arguments, cleaner handovers, and a new recurring revenue stream.

Buttons:

Primary CTA button: Apply to Become a Partner → link this to a prop or placeholder URL like /partner-apply (I’ll later replace with a Tally.so form URL).

Secondary CTA button: Book a 10-Minute Partner Call → link to a placeholder URL /partner-call (I’ll later replace with my SavvyCal link).

Also add a small text link under the hero CTAs:
Built for developer agencies, freelancers, and fractional CTOs who want fewer launch surprises.

On the right side of the hero, include a visual block:

A card or illustration representing a dev team at desks with screens and a client on a call. Use simple SVG / icon composition in React.

SECTION: Who VerAIQ Partners Are For

Heading: Who the VerAIQ Partner Programme Is For

Body text (use bullet points in a 2-column layout or stacked cards on mobile):

Developer agencies building apps for non-technical founders

Freelance developers tired of messy UAT and launch delays

Fractional CTOs and product consultants who want structured QA without hiring testers

Paragraph:

If your clients keep asking “when can we launch?” and testing always turns into a blame game, VerAIQ is for you.

SECTION: The Problem

Heading: The Problem: Speed Without Structure Kills Trust

Copy:

Your team ships. The client skims. Users find the real bugs in the wild.

You get:

Endless messages about “broken” flows that were never clearly tested

Last-minute UAT panics

Clients blaming “quality” when the real issue is lack of process

You didn’t sign up to run their QA department. But right now, you’re acting like it.

Style: put this in a dark card with subtle accent border (teal/green).

SECTION: How VerAIQ Fixes This

Heading: How VerAIQ Fixes This

Copy:

VerAIQ is a guided launch readiness tool for non-technical founders.

It:

Walks your clients through structured test flows

Logs issues in plain language they understand

Produces a clear launch readiness report you can align around

No extra testers on your payroll. No more vague “it feels buggy” feedback.

Layout: two-column; on the right, show another visual card or icon grid representing:

checklists, bugs, and a readiness gauge.

SECTION: How Agencies Use VerAIQ (TESTING SCENARIOS)

Heading: How Agencies Use VerAIQ With Their Clients

Short intro text:
You can use VerAIQ in three ways depending on how your clients work:

Then show 3 cards with these exact texts:

Client-Led Testing (default)
The founder follows VerAIQ’s guided test flows. They log issues in plain language. You review the readiness report together and agree what must be fixed before launch.

Agency-Led Testing
Your team runs the tests on behalf of the client using a VerAIQ plan. Ideal for busy founders or when you offer a premium “we’ll test it for you” service.

Hybrid Testing
The founder logs issues; your team verifies and prioritises them. VerAIQ generates a shared readiness score so you can make transparent, aligned launch decisions.

Visually, surround these with a subtle background panel and an illustration/icon cluster that hints at collaboration (e.g. multiple avatars, arrows, screens).

SECTION: How the Partner Programme Works

Heading: How the VerAIQ Partner Programme Works

Copy:

1. You introduce VerAIQ at the right moment
When your client says “When can we launch?”, that’s your cue.

2. They sign up using your partner link
They get guided testing. You stay in control.

3. You both get clarity
You see a clean list of issues and a readiness score.

4. You get paid
You earn a share of their subscription and any Expert Review add-ons.

Render this as a 4-step horizontal or vertical timeline with icons.

SECTION: Commission & Benefits

Heading: Commission Structure & Partner Benefits

Layout: two columns: “Agencies” and “Freelancers / Indie Devs”.

Text:

For Agencies

20% recurring commission for 12 months on all VerAIQ subscriptions

30% commission on the first Expert Review (£450) you route

Upgrade to 25% recurring after 10+ paying clients per year

For Freelancers / Indie Devs

15% recurring commission for 12 months

25% on the first Expert Review for each referred client

Beyond cash, you get:

Fewer late-night “is it ready?” messages

Cleaner project endings and renewals

A more “grown-up” QA process without hiring testers

SECTION: What You Get as a Partner

Heading: What You Get as a VerAIQ Partner

Render as a 3x2 grid of cards.

Bullet content:

A unique partner link and simple performance dashboard

A co-branded launch readiness PDF for your clients

Email and WhatsApp scripts you can copy-paste into your workflow

A “VerAIQ Partner” badge for your website and proposals

Priority access to new features and agency-only resources

A repeatable way to reduce UAT chaos on every project

SECTION: How to Join

Heading: How to Join the Partner Programme

Copy:

1. Apply via the short form – tell us about your clients and projects.
2. Jump on a 10-minute call – we confirm fit and walk you through the workflow.
3. Get your partner kit – link, scripts, co-branded PDF, and badge.
4. Start introducing VerAIQ on your next project.

Under this, repeat the two main CTA buttons:

Apply to Become a Partner → same Tally.so placeholder URL

Book a 10-Minute Partner Call → same SavvyCal placeholder URL

Add a small reassurance line under the buttons:
No minimum volume. We review partner performance every 90 days to keep the programme focused and high-quality.

SECTION: FAQ (Short)

Heading: Questions We Get a Lot

Provide 3 FAQ items with the following content:

Q1: Can we use VerAIQ on all clients?
A1: Yes, but it’s especially effective for non-technical founders and teams doing their own testing.

Q2: Do you handle support?
A2: Yes. We support the VerAIQ tool and guided flows. You keep focusing on delivery and client relationships.

Q3: Is there a minimum volume?
A3: No minimum. Start with a single project. We review partner performance every 90 days.

FOOTER CHANGES

In whatever global footer or main layout component is used for the VerAIQ marketing site (e.g. components/Footer.tsx or similar), add a link:

Text: Partner Programme

Href: /partners

Make no assumptions about the Q³ WordPress site; just ensure /partners exists and works so I can manually add a “Partner with VerAIQ” link from the Q³ site.

GENERAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

Use semantic HTML where possible (<main>, <section>, <header>, <footer>).

Use Tailwind for spacing/typography; e.g. max-w-5xl mx-auto px-4 py-16.

Don’t refactor unrelated components or pages. Touch only the new /partners page and, minimally, the shared footer component to add the “Partner Programme” link.

Keep the design clean, professional, and consistent with a modern SaaS brand.

DELIVERABLES

A fully implemented app/partners/page.tsx (or .jsx) React component with all sections above.

Updated footer component with a Partner Programme link pointing to /partners.

Simple illustration components / gradient blocks where image placeholders are needed so that the page looks visually complete even before I swap in custom artwork later.
