            <h1>About Qube Catalyst</h1>
            <p>
            <p>
              <p>
                I'm <strong>Pearl Oguchi</strong>, founder of Qube Catalyst. I help non-technical founders and established service
                businesses turn messy app builds, custom systems and “half-finished” software into launch-ready products that actually
                work in the real world.
              </p>

            </p>

            <p>
              I bring 20+ years of experience steering complex software releases end-to-end, including 8 years at Meta
              working across engineering, product and delivery teams to make sure what gets built actually aligns with users,
              commercial goals and the overall product strategy.
            </p>

            <p>
              My work there involved being embedded across the full app development lifecycle — from early idea and
              concept validation, to shaping the roadmap, to launch and iteration. I saw exactly where things break, how
              scope creep starts, and how misaligned teams create poor decisions, delays and expensive rework.

            </p>

            <p>
              <p>
                Now I focus on non-technical founders, lean startup teams and established service businesses who are building serious
                products with agencies or freelancers, or modernising old manual processes into proper software. You shouldn’t need to
                become an engineer to understand your app roadmap, challenge unclear decisions or protect your app development budget.
                You just want a product that behaves well, makes sense to users and staff, and is truly ready for launch.
              </p>

        <h2>Why Q³ Exists</h2>
        <p>
          Established service businesses run into the same issues from a different angle: you're trying to modernise your
          operations, replace spreadsheets, or upgrade outdated manual processes, or you just had a great idea for an app, but you're not sure whether the app, portal
          or system you're paying for is actually fit for purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          You're responsible for the product, but nobody has given you a clear definition of "ready," "safe," or "good
          enough." You just want it to work.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight-text">
          <strong>Q³ exists to fix that gap.</strong><br>
          I give you the technical clarity, product insight and leadership you need to build and launch products and
          internal systems that work in the real world, not just in a demo. From app idea and digitisation plans to
          go-to-market, you get a partner who helps you avoid costly mistakes and make confident decisions.

        <h2>What's Actually Happening (But Nobody Says It)</h2>
        <p>
          <p>
            Most non-technical founders and business owners leading software projects are stuck between two worlds:
            you're expected to own a technical product or new system, but you don't have the visibility, language or
            confidence to challenge decisions made by agencies, freelancers or internal teams.
          </p>

        </p>
        <div class="problem-list">
          <p>Your agency or freelancer shows you a demo.</p>
              <p>You hope it's good.</p>
              <p>You guess at priorities.</p>
              <p>You sign off changes you're not truly confident in.</p>
              <p class="problem-climax">And then, near launch, everything unravels.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="highlight-text">
              <strong>Q³ steps in long before that point.</strong><br>
              I help you cut through the noise so you can see what’s being built, why it matters, and how each decision
              affects the product or system you’re trying to deliver. I keep the build aligned with your users, customers and
              business goals, so you stop guessing and start leading with clarity.

        <h2>How Q³ Fixes This</h2>
        <div class="benefits-grid">
          <div class="benefit-box">
            <h3>You get clarity from the very beginning</h3>
            <p>
              Whether you’re shaping an early app idea or modernising how your business operates, I help you define what’s being
              built, why it matters and how it should work in the real world. You get a clear foundation before money is wasted or
              scope creep takes over.
            </p>

          </div>
          <div class="benefit-box">
            <h3>You see your product through real users, not demos</h3>
            <p> From the first prototype to the final build, we look at your key journeys end-to-end and expose the gaps your users,
            customers or staff will hit: friction, confusion, misaligned features, missing flows. You stop being surprised at the end.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="benefit-box">
            <h3>You get priorities backed by evidence, not opinions</h3>
            <p>As the product evolves, I rank every issue by severity, business impact and user risk. This gives you
              calm, structured decision-making from inception to launch with no more firefighting or guessing.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="benefit-box">
            <h3>Your agency or team gets tighter direction</h3>
            <p>Agencies, freelancers or internal devs get clearer expectations, sharper feedback and practical guidance.
              Alignment stays tight, and the product moves forward instead of sideways.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="benefit-box">
            <h3>You know exactly when you're ready for launch and when you’re not</h3>
            <p>I help you define what “launch-ready” means for your product: stability, usability, coherence, trust, and
              commercial viability. You don’t go to market on gut feel, you go with confidence.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="benefit-box">
            <h3>You gain a strategic partner across the whole journey</h3>
            <p>Not just on launch day. I support you through the entire lifecycle, shaping early decisions, reviewing
              each iteration, identifying risks, and making sure the product you bring to market actually matches the
              promise you’ve been selling to users and investors.</p>
