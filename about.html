            <h1>About Qube Catalyst</h1>
            <p>
              I'm <strong>Pearl Oguchi</strong>, founder of Qube Catalyst. I help founders turn messy app
              builds into launch-ready products that actually work.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've spent over 20 years working on product quality and release in software,
              including 8 years at Meta. My work there involved being embedded across the end-to-end
              development process – from early ideas to launch – seeing exactly where things break and
              how misaligned teams create chaos.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now I focus on non-technical founders and lean teams who are building serious products
              without a dedicated technical lead. You shouldn't have to become an engineer to get a product
              that behaves well and makes sense in the real world.

        <h2>Why Q³ Exists</h2>
        <p>
          Most founders building an app without a technical lead run into the same problems: they're paying for development, but they can't see what's really happening. Demos look fine until they don't. User flows feel slightly off but you can't quite articulate why. Deadlines slip. Decisions are made that don't make commercial sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          You're responsible for the product, but nobody has given you a clear definition of "ready," "safe," or "good enough."
        </p>
        <p class="highlight-text">
          <strong>Q³ exists to fix that gap.</strong><br>
          I give you the technical clarity, product insight and leadership you need to build a product that actually works in the real world — not just in a demo.
        </p>

        <h2>What's Actually Happening (But Nobody Says It)</h2>
        <p>
          Most non-technical founders building apps are stuck between two worlds: you're expected to lead a technical product, but you don't have the technical visibility or language to challenge decisions.
        </p>
        <div class="problem-list">
          <p>Your agency or freelancer shows you a demo.</p>
          <p>You hope it's good.</p>
          <p>You guess at priorities.</p>
          <p>You sign off changes you're not truly confident in.</p>
          <p class="problem-climax">And then, near launch, everything unravels.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="highlight-text">
          <strong>Q³ steps in long before that point.</strong><br>
          I review your flows like a user would, your priorities like an operator would, and your build like a product lead would.<br>
          You stop guessing, and start leading.
        </p>

        <h2>How Q³ Fixes This</h2>
        <div class="benefits-grid">
          <div class="benefit-box">
            <h3>You get clarity from the very beginning</h3>
            <p>Whether you’re still shaping your idea or already knee-deep in development, I help you define what’s being built, why it matters, and how it should work in the real world. You get a clear foundation before money gets wasted.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="benefit-box">
            <h3>You see your product through real users, not demos</h3>
            <p>From the first prototype to the final build, I walk your key journeys end-to-end and expose the gaps your users will hit: friction, confusion, mis-built features, missing flows. You stop being surprised at the end.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="benefit-box">
            <h3>You get priorities backed by evidence, not opinions</h3>
            <p>As the product evolves, I rank every issue by severity, business impact and user risk. This gives you calm, structured decision-making from inception to launch — no more firefighting or guessing.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="benefit-box">
            <h3>Your agency or team gets tighter direction</h3>
            <p>Agencies, freelancers or internal devs get clearer expectations, sharper feedback and practical guidance. Alignment stays tight, and the product moves forward instead of sideways.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="benefit-box">
            <h3>You know exactly when you're ready for launch and when you’re not</h3>
            <p>I help you define what “launch-ready” means for your product: stability, usability, coherence, trust, and commercial viability. You don’t go to market on gut feel — you go with confidence.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="benefit-box">
            <h3>You gain a strategic partner across the whole journey</h3>
            <p>Not just at launch day. I support you through the entire lifecycle — shaping early decisions, reviewing each iteration, identifying risks, and making sure the product you bring to market actually matches the promise you’ve been selling to users and investors.</p>
