        <h1>About Qube Catalyst</h1>
        <p>
          I’m <strong>Pearl Oguchi</strong>, founder of Qube Catalyst. I help founders turn messy app
          builds into launch-ready products that actually work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve spent over 20 years working on product quality and release in software,
          including 8 years at Meta. My work there involved being embedded across the end-to-end
          development process – from early ideas to launch – seeing exactly where things break and
          how misaligned teams create chaos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I focus on non-technical founders and lean teams who are building serious products
          without a dedicated technical lead. You shouldn’t have to become an engineer to get a product
          that behaves well and makes sense in the real world.

        <h2>How I think about product confidence</h2>
        <p>
          Product confidence is about more than “does it load?”. It’s whether the experience your users
          have actually matches the promise you’re making in your pitch deck, your marketing, and your
          investor conversations.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work blends:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Technical clarity</strong> – making sense of what your team or agency has actually built.</li>
          <li><strong>Issue triage</strong> – separating “annoying” from “launch-blocking” problems.</li>
          <li><strong>Journey and design thinking</strong> – checking whether flows are usable, not just “implemented.”
          </li>
          <li><strong>Go-to-market awareness</strong> – making sure the product experience supports your growth story.
          </li>
        </ul>

            <p>
