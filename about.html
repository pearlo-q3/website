            <h1>About Qube Catalyst</h1>

            <p>
              I'm <strong>Pearl Oguchi</strong>, founder of Qube Catalyst. I help non-technical founders and established
              service
              businesses turn messy app builds, custom systems and “half-finished” software into launch-ready products
              that actually
              work in the real world.
            </p>

            <p>
              I bring 20+ years of experience steering complex software releases end-to-end, including 8 years at Meta
              working across engineering, product and delivery teams to make sure what gets built actually aligns with
              users,
              commercial goals and the overall product strategy.
            </p>

            <p>
              My work there involved being embedded across the full app development lifecycle, from early idea and
              concept validation, to shaping the roadmap, to launch and iteration. I saw exactly where things break, how
              scope creep starts, and how misaligned teams create poor decisions, delays and expensive rework.

            </p>

            <p>
            <p>
              Now I focus on non-technical founders, lean startup teams and established service businesses who are
              building serious products with agencies or freelancers, often after reading software agency reviews and
              still feeling unsure. You shouldn’t need to
              become an engineer to understand your app roadmap, challenge unclear decisions or protect your app
              development budget.
              You just want a product that behaves well, makes sense to users and staff, and is truly ready for launch.
            </p>

        <h2>Why Q³ Exists</h2>
        <p>
          Established service businesses run into the same issues from a different angle: you're trying to modernise
          your
          operations, replace spreadsheets, or upgrade outdated manual processes, or you just had a great idea for an
          app, but you're not sure whether the app, portal
          or system you're paying for is actually fit for purpose. That’s usually when the outsourcing app development
          risks become real.
        </p>
        <p>
          You're responsible for the product, but nobody has given you a clear definition of "ready," "safe," or "good
          enough." You just want it to work.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight-text">
          <strong>Q³ exists to fix that gap.</strong><br>
          I give you the technical clarity, product insight and leadership you need to build and launch products and
          internal systems that work in the real world, not just in a demo. From app idea and digitisation plans to
          go-to-market, you get a partner who helps you avoid costly mistakes and make confident decisions.

        </p>

        <h2>What's Actually Happening (But Nobody Says It)</h2>
        <p>
        <p>
          Most non-technical founders and business owners leading software projects are stuck between two worlds:
          you're expected to own a technical product or new system, but you don't have the visibility, language or
          confidence to challenge decisions made by your teams, or interpret app development progress tracking.
        </p>

        </p>
        <div class="problem-list">
          <p>Your agency or freelancer shows you a demo.</p>
          <p>You hope it's good.</p>
          <p>You guess at priorities.</p>
          <p>You sign off changes you're not truly confident in.</p>
          <p class="problem-climax">And then, near launch, everything unravels.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="highlight-text">
          <strong>Q³ steps in long before that point.</strong><br>
          I help you cut through the noise so you can see what’s being built, why it matters, and how each decision
          affects the product or system you’re trying to deliver. I keep the build aligned with your users, customers
          and
          business goals, so you stop guessing and start leading with clarity.

        <h2>How Q³ Fixes This</h2>
        <div class="benefits-grid">
          <div class="benefit-box">
            <h3>You get clarity from the very beginning</h3>
            <p>
              Whether you’re shaping an early app idea or modernising how your business operates, I help you define
              what’s being
              built, why it matters and how it should work in the real world. You get a clear foundation before money is
              wasted or
              scope creep takes over.
            </p>

          </div>
          <div class="benefit-box">
            <h3>You see your product through real users, not demos</h3>
            <p> From the first prototype to the final build, we look at your key journeys end-to-end and expose the gaps
              your users,
              customers or staff will hit: friction, confusion, misaligned features, missing flows. You stop being
              surprised at the end.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="benefit-box">
            <h3>You get priorities backed by evidence, not opinions</h3>
            <p>As the product evolves, I rank every issue by severity, business impact and user risk. This gives you
              calm, structured decision-making from inception to launch with no more firefighting or guessing.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="benefit-box">
            <h3>Your agency or team gets tighter direction</h3>
            <p>Agencies, freelancers or internal devs get clearer expectations, sharper feedback and practical guidance.
              Alignment stays tight, and the product moves forward instead of sideways.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="benefit-box">
            <h3>You know exactly when you're ready for launch and when you’re not</h3>
            <p>I help you define what “launch-ready” means for your product: stability, usability, coherence, trust, and
              commercial viability. You don’t go to market on gut feel, you go with confidence.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="benefit-box">
            <h3>You gain a strategic partner across the whole journey</h3>
            <p>Not just on launch day. I support you through the entire lifecycle, shaping early decisions, reviewing
              each iteration, identifying risks, and making sure the product you bring to market actually matches the
              promise you’ve been selling to users and investors.</p>

              decisions that affect ongoing app hosting costs.

              <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;padding-bottom:1.5rem;">A Micro Confidence Review is a focused pass over 3–4 critical journeys; the flows that determine whether people trust and complete key actions. I walk them like a real user and try to break them, document where things break or confuse, and return a prioritised action plan your team can act on immediately.<br><br>For many founders, this is the point where they would normally rely on software acceptance testing or user acceptance testing for business owners, but without the technical framing. My role is to translate that sign-off moment into clear, human decisions you can stand behind.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom:0.75rem;background:#fff;border-radius:12px;border-left:4px solid #00796B;overflow:hidden;">

              <span>How fast is a Micro Confidence Review, and what do you need from us?</span>
              <span class="faq-icon" style="font-size:1.5rem;color:#00796B;transition:transform 0.3s;">+</span>

              <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;padding-bottom:1.5rem;">It's designed to be lightweight and fast. I don't need full documentation or long discovery cycles, only access to the product (staging is fine), context on the key journeys, and any known constraints.<br><br>Some teams already have an internal app launch checklist they're trying to work through. Others don't. Either way, the output becomes a clear reference for what needs attention now versus what can safely wait.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height:0;overflow:hidden;transition:max-height 0.3s ease-out;padding:0 1.5rem;">
              <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;padding-bottom:1.5rem;">I don't replace your agency or second-guess them publicly. I work alongside you, privately, to clarify what's solid, what's assumed, and where the real risks sit.<br><br>That's especially valuable when founders are worried about outsourcing app development risks or quietly wondering whether changing software agencies mid project would actually improve things — or just create new problems. My role is to help you see clearly before decisions escalate.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom:0.75rem;background:#fff;border-radius:12px;border-left:4px solid #00796B;overflow:hidden;">

              <span>What happens if our project is already messy or halfway built?</span>
              <span class="faq-icon" style="font-size:1.5rem;color:#00796B;transition:transform 0.3s;">+</span>

            <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height:0;overflow:hidden;transition:max-height 0.3s ease-out;padding:0 1.5rem;">
              <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;padding-bottom:1.5rem;">That's normal. Most people bring me in once things feel unclear, not at the start.<br><br>At that stage, the work is about understanding how the project is actually being run: scope, decision-making, and trade-offs. This is often when founders start revisiting fixed price vs hourly software models after the fact, trying to explain instability. I help you make sense of where you are and what matters next.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;padding-bottom:1.5rem;">I'm not running a formal audit or rewriting code. My focus is whether the product behaves in a way you can confidently approve.<br><br>Where it's useful, I surface indicators that function as a code quality check for non-programmers; things you can understand, question, and use in conversations with your build team without needing to read source code.</p>

              <span>How does the Fractional Launch Partner service work in practice?</span>
              <span class="faq-icon" style="font-size:1.5rem;color:#00796B;transition:transform 0.3s;">+</span>

              <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;padding-bottom:1.5rem;">This is for teams beyond first launch who need continuity. I stay alongside you across releases, helping you make cleaner decisions as the product evolves.<br><br>That often includes anticipating downstream realities, like how features affect support, stability, and app hosting costs, so you're not surprised by what it takes to keep the system running once it's live.</p>

              <span>When should someone use VerAIQ instead of working with you directly?</span>

            <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height:0;overflow:hidden;transition:max-height 0.3s ease-out;padding:0 1.5rem;">
              <p style="margin-bottom:1rem;padding-bottom:1.5rem;">VerAIQ is for earlier or quieter moments, when you're not ready to involve anyone else yet.<br><br>Founders use it to organise their thinking, clarify what they've been told, and prepare for conversations with an agency, often around things like software development contract templates or expectations before work starts. It's self-serve orientation, not advice, and it often helps people decide whether they even need hands-on support.</p>
