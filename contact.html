        <h2>Book a Free Strategy Call</h2>
        <p class="calendar-intro">
          Share a quick snapshot of what you're building, whether it's a new app, a customer portal, a booking system
          or an internal tool to replace spreadsheets and manual processes. Tell me who's building it for you (agency,
          freelancer, internal team or AI-assisted) and what you're worried about: delays, unclear decisions, scope creep
          or feeling unsure if it's really ready to launch.
        </p>
        <p class="calendar-intro">
          On the call, I'll outline the smartest way we can work together, from a one-off Micro Confidence Review to a
          deeper launch partnership for non-technical founders and established SMEs.

          system or current build. A short message with a link and your biggest concern is enough to start.

                <p>“Working with Pearl on a recent web application review was exceptional. Her precision, professionalism,
                  and ability to spot issues that others miss made a huge difference. Pearl identified improvements,
                  highlighted strengths, and delivered feedback that was both constructive and immediately actionable.</p>
                <p>Her commitment to quality is unmistakable. If you need a specialist who brings clarity, excellence and
                  top-tier attention to detail to every project, I cannot recommend Pearl highly enough.”</p>

                delivered exactly what we needed: a fast, focused review that flagged critical issues and gave my
                developer clear, actionable fixes ahead of user testing.</p>
              <p>Her approach was professional, efficient and incredibly helpful. Thanks to Pearl’s input, we went into
