          <h1>Introducing VerAIQ: The Product Readiness Tool for Founders Building Without a Tech Lead</h1>
        </header>

        <div class="article-content">
          <p class="article-intro">
            Most non-technical founders and business owners are flying blind when it comes to launch readiness. You get
            a demo of your app, customer portal or internal tool. It looks fine. Your developer or agency says,
            “We’re ready.”
          </p>

          <p>
            But you can’t see what’s beneath the surface. You don’t know if the user flows break under real use, if key
            journeys like sign-up, booking or payments will hold up, or if this is a solid build or a house of cards.
            That gap, that uncertainty, is where launches go wrong and app budgets quietly disappear.
          </p>

          <h2>The Real Problem VerAIQ Solves</h2>
          <p>
            When you don’t have a technical co-founder or in-house tech lead, you usually end up doing one of two
            things:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>You trust the team and hope for the best</strong><br>
              Risky. If something goes wrong on launch day, your users and customers won’t care whose fault it was.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>You delay the launch because something feels off</strong><br>
              Also expensive. Every week you wait is another week the market moves on, staff get frustrated and
              your app, portal or system still isn’t live.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Neither path gives you confidence. Both force you to guess. <strong>VerAIQ exists to give you a clear,
              structured way to answer one question:</strong> “Are we actually ready to launch?”
          </p>

          <h2>What VerAIQ Actually Does</h2>
          <p>
            VerAIQ guides you, step by step, through a clear, plain-English process that helps you surface the real
            truth about your product or system. It works whether you're:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>launching a new app with an agency or freelance developer</li>
            <li>building a customer portal or booking system for your SME</li>
            <li>replacing spreadsheets and manual processes with an internal tool</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Along the way, VerAIQ helps you clarify:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>What users or customers are supposed to do</strong>; your core journeys, not just what the demo
              shows</li>
            <li><strong>What absolutely must work on day one</strong>; the flows that carry the highest risk to trust,
              revenue or operations</li>
            <li><strong>Which journeys are fragile</strong> – where people are likely to drop off, get stuck or get
              confused</li>
            <li><strong>Where unknowns or gaps could embarrass you at launch</strong> – things you haven’t seen yet, but
              your users will</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Then it turns all of that into a structured <strong>Product Readiness View</strong> – a simple snapshot of
            whether you're genuinely ready to launch, or heading for a round of firefighting. No technical experience
            needed. No trying to decode developer language. Just clarity.
          </p>

          <h2>Why It Was Built</h2>
          <p>
            I’ve spent years helping non-technical founders and established SMEs who were brilliant at their ideas and
            market, but completely lost when assessing whether their product was “good enough” to go live.
          </p>
          <p>The questions were always the same:</p>
          <p>“Is this timeline normal?”</p>
          <p>“Why does every build suddenly explode right before launch?”</p>
          <p>“My developer says it’s done, but… is it really?”</p>
          <p>
            You shouldn’t need a fractional CTO just to understand your own app or system. VerAIQ gives you a starting
            point: a guided way to verify before you trust, so you can launch with your eyes open instead of with
            crossed fingers.
          </p>

          <h2>Who VerAIQ Is For</h2>
          <p>
            VerAIQ is built for people leading software projects without a deep technical background, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>non-technical founders building an app with freelancers, agencies or offshore dev teams</li>
            <li>product owners responsible for launch, but not for writing code</li>
            <li>established SMEs building customer portals, booking systems or internal tools for the first time</li>
            <li>business owners replacing spreadsheets and manual processes with software</li>
            <li>teams who need an objective way to assess launch readiness before going live</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If that’s you, VerAIQ gives you structure and certainty in a space that usually has neither.
          </p>
