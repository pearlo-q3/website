          <p class="article-intro">
            I'm excited to announce the launch of <strong>VerAIQ</strong>, a guided tool designed specifically for non-technical founders who want to know if their product is truly ready to launch.
          </p>

          <h2>The Problem VerAIQ Solves</h2>
          <p>
            If you're building an app or software product without a technical background, you've probably experienced this: your development team shows you a demo, it looks fine, they say it's ready, and you have no real way of knowing whether that's true.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can't see what's happening under the surface. You don't know if the user flows actually make sense. You're not sure if there are obvious gaps that will frustrate your customers the moment they start using it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most founders in this position do one of two things:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Trust their team and hope for the best (risky)</li>
            <li>Delay the launch indefinitely because they're not confident (expensive)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Neither option is great. You shouldn't have to guess whether your product is ready. You deserve a clear, structured way to assess readiness without needing to become a developer yourself.
          </p>

          <h2>What VerAIQ Does</h2>
          <p>
            VerAIQ walks you through a guided, plain-English process to capture the important details about your product:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>How your product works</strong> — the key user journeys and what users are trying to accomplish</li>
            <li><strong>What matters most</strong> — the critical features and flows that must work perfectly at launch</li>
            <li><strong>Where the risks are</strong> — potential problem areas, edge cases, and unknowns</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Based on your answers, VerAIQ generates a <strong>structured readiness view</strong> — a clear picture of where you stand and what still needs attention before you can confidently go live.
          </p>

          <h2>Why I Built It</h2>
          <p>
            After years of working with founders who were struggling to get clarity on their builds, I kept seeing the same pattern: smart, capable people who knew their market inside out, but who felt completely lost when it came to judging whether their product was actually ready.
          </p>
          <p>
            They'd ask me questions like:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>"Is this normal? Should it take this long?"</li>
            <li>"My developer says it's ready, but something feels off. Am I being paranoid?"</li>
            <li>"How do I know if this is good enough to launch?"</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These are valid questions. And you shouldn't need to hire a fractional CTO just to get basic answers about your product's readiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            VerAIQ is my way of making that initial clarity accessible to every founder, regardless of technical background or budget.
          </p>

          <h2>Who It's For</h2>
          <p>
            VerAIQ is built for non-technical founders who:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Are working with freelancers, agencies, or small dev teams</li>
            <li>Don't have a technical co-founder or CTO</li>
            <li>Want an objective way to assess their product's launch readiness</li>
            <li>Need to make confident go/no-go decisions without guessing</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Try VerAIQ</h2>
